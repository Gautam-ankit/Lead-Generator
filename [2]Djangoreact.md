# Integrating React & Django

Installation needed:
  - Webpack
  - Bable
  - React Preset
  - webpack.config file
  
  
SO we will jump into leadmanager folder and create a webapp naming frontend

Now we need to create some more folder

~mkdir -p ./frontend/src/components

~mkdir -p ./frontend/{static, templates}/frontend

Src is the folder where all react and redux application will exist.
templates is the folder which will handle index.html file
static will be the compiles javascript files with build it will give a file naming main.js

# start installing webpack

lets move to the root folder

~cd..

~npm init -y

npm is a node module for that node must be installed(nodejs.org), moreover it create a package.json file with all other dependecies.
